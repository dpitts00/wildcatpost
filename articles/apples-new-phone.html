        <p>It seems like every time the weather changes, Apple releases a new iPhone. This year,
four models are on the line: the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone
12 pro max. The company made changes that include display size, sizes and design,
the price, the cameras, battery life, specs, accessories, "committing to the
environment,"and the most significant upgrade, 5G. So should you run out and
purchase a new iPhone this season? Read on to find out.</p>

        <p><b>The Display</b></p>

<p>All new iPhone models have a Super Retina OLED display, which packs 2532 x 1170
pixels, or 460 pixels per inch. Compared to the iPhone 11's LCD screen that contains
1792 x 828 pixels, which works out at 326 pixels per inch. There will be a slight
difference in the display's quality. The more pixels, the higher resolution the Phone will
display; the Phone with higher pixels will have more clarity and details in information
than a phone with fewer pixels. </p>



        <p><b>Sizes and design</b></p>
        <p>The design has significantly improved, going back to the O.G iPhone 5 design mixed
with the iPhone 11. The round edges have been changed back to the original square
edges. Making the iPhone 12 11% thinner, 15% smaller, and 16% smaller than the
iPhone 11. The materials used have also been improved from aluminum and glass to
surgical grade aluminum and Ceramic Shield, which is 4x more robust than the regular
smartphone glass.</p>

<p><b>The Cameras</b></p>
<p> Not much has been changed about the cameras; the iPhone 12 offers ultrawide and
selfie photos on night mode. It can also take HDR videos with Dolby vision. HDR
meaning high dynamic range photos or videos, giving them the best exposure possible.
And Dolby's vision provides more color depth as well as the brightness of the video. </p>

<p><b>Battery life, specs, accessories</b></p>
<p> The battery life of the iPhone 12 and the 11 is the same, with 17 hours of video
playback. The A14 Bionic is the fastest chip with a GPU and a 50% CPU than other
smartphone chips, creating more rapid frames to load your images and play videos,
games, and other graphics at a much higher rate. This year the most exciting accessory has been introduced with the iPhone 12. The Magsafe accessory has made it so that
you can connect to your Phones such as a MagSafe wallet, a MagSafe case, and a
charger. This feature will charge your Phone at a much faster rate and allow you to
connect to the other accessories easily with MagSafe technology.</p>

<p><b>False Advertisements</b></p>
<p>The commitment environment means that they will start to take out the free ear pods
and to charge the plug. They say it's for the environment, but it's really for their profit.
They have made the phone box's size smaller and have taken out the ear pods and the
charge plug. I agree with taking it out for both their profit and the environment. At least
in my experience, I rarely even take out the charging plug and the earphones because I
would use my old plug and headphones. So I think their choice of taking things out
makes sense, to make them more money and advertise their profit margins as for the
environment.</p>

<p><b>5G</b></p>
<p>This is the most significant upgrade of the year; at last, 5G has finally come to iPhones.
The 5G will boost faster downloads, high-quality video streaming, fast connection, more
responsive gaming, and facetime in high definition. It will also reach speeds up to
4Gbps; the iPhone 12 Pro also features a smart data mode that extends battery life by
accessing 5G only when needed. Although 5G isn't a stable and worldwide network, it
will be soon until we finally get a hold of the iPhone 12 and 5G benefits.</p>

<p>Personally, it is not worth updating this year as the 5G network hasn&#39;t been covered
everywhere and is not stable enough. But if you are addicted to Apple like I am, I
recommend getting the iPhone 12 since it has almost the same price as the pro for the
same specs. Apple has always had its phones slow down to the newer updates to
encourage consumers to purchase a new iPhone.</p>

<p><b>Personal experience</b></p>
<p> After two months of using the iPhone 12 pro, I can say there is a slight difference in the
network speed, not significant that you would be able to notice, and the Phone is
smaller than the 11; I think it has a better feel to it as well. But there isn't a significant
difference between the 12 and the 11. If you don't need a new phone, I wouldn't
recommend it. But if you do, or you are a hardcore Apple fan, then this Phone will be an
excellent device for you!</p>
