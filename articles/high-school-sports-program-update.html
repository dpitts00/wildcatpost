        <h4>High School Sports Program Update</h4>
        <h5>Carson Poovey</h5>

        <p>The WSOC High School prides itself on the sports it offers and the participation of its passionate albeit tiny student body. During a global pandemic in which different classes can hardly interact with each other even at a small school, sports programs seem like a distant, unrealistic afterthought. However, the high school plans to offer a plethora of pre-existing and new sports to its students. To discuss changes to the seasons and new sports offered by the school, I spoke to the schoolâ€™s Athletic Director Armando Castro. Coach Castro shed light on the obstacles he and the rest of the faculty have faced in their pursuit to offer sporting opportunities during such times while explaining the various sports and their seasons.</p>

        <p><b>The Sports</b> - The WSOC High School will offer many of the sports that they have in the past, while adding a few new programs based on student interest. Sports offered in years past and this year include boys and girls basketball, boys and girls soccer, boys and girls cross country, boys and girls track and field, and girls volleyball. New sports this year will be boys and girls golf, and wrestling. </p>

        <p><b>The Seasons</b> - Typically, there would be three sports seasons within the school year, fall, winter and spring. However, regulations and obstacles have forced the CIF (California Interscholastic Federation) to condense sports competition into just two seasons, winter and spring. At such a small school like Waldorf, this may pose issues to multi-sport students, but the prospect of sporting events is exciting nonetheless.

        <p><b>Strength & Conditioning Program</b> - Coach Castro plans on developing a strength and conditioning program to accompany the growing sports program. He points out that stronger athletes contribute to stronger teams, and strength and conditioning significantly reduces the risk of injury in athletes as well. Coach Castro is working to create stronger, safer and more competitive teams for the high school. Overall, Waldorf sports programs are flourishing and everyone involved highly encourages participation from everyone in high school.
