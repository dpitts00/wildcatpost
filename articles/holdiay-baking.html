Who doesn’t love to fill up their home with the scent of yummy snacks while getting to spend time baking with their loved ones? Whether it’s some hot cocoa to sip by the fireplace, latkes enjoyed during a game of dreidel, or a gingerbread cookie while singing carols with your family, it is no question that sweet and savory sustenance supplies scores of smiles. Here are favorites from the WSOC high school!</p>
