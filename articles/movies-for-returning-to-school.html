        <h4>Movies for Returing to School</h4>
        <h5>Antonio Dardis</h5>
        <p>  Now that back school is back in session, students are relieved to be face-to-face with teachers and friends. But school is still, well, school. Students miss the free time they had during online learning, and the adverse effects of stress from grades, tests, projects, and homework are already beginning to sit on students' shoulders. Entertainment is one way to help students and parents relieve stress, especially the time-honored traditions of sitting down as a family, and enjoying a good, old-fashioned motion picture, otherwise known as a movie. Here are my top three suggestions for the best movies to watch with the family to help ease the school year's busyness.

<p>  One of the all-time best movies involving a school getaway is Paramount Pictures Ferris Bueller's Day Off. In this 1986 comedy, a highschool hothead named Ferris decides to break from learning by pretending to be sick. Ferris uses his pranking experience to fool his parents into letting him stay home. From there, he picks up his best friend, Cameron, and the two of them return to school to "rescue" Ferris' girlfriend, Sloane. The three of them go wandering around the streets of Chicago, enjoying all the city has to offer. This film shows Ferris' tips and tricks to fool the staff and his school, and in the end, the entire city of Chicago. It's outlandish, and scenes set up some hilarious moments that will have you rolling on the floor with laughter. Ferris' tactics provide a bit of escapism for students, with the side benefit of giving some pretty fun ideas of how to get out of school and have a grand adventure.

<p>  Paramount Pictures' 2003 School Of Rock is another movie option that offers a different perspective on the "already done with school" scenario. This musical comedy, starring Jack Black, tells the story of a washed-up guitarist named Dewey Finn who was kicked out of his band and desperately needed money to pay his substitute teacher roommate the rent. Dewey intercepts a call intended for his roommate from a prestigious school and decides to take up Ned's identity and teach in his place. Less than a few days into his teaching "career," he notices that the kids have incredible musical talent, so he does the one thing he knows best and replaces all lessons with those of rock and roll brilliance. The rest of the movie explores their journey to the rock and roll championship, Battle Of The Bands. This movie is incredibly witty, and the interactions between a rock guitarist and uptight teachers are wildly comedic. The main character is perhaps the best Jack Black role to date, and the child actors hold their own in the production, providing for some great moments that help give the film the incredible reputation it retains to this day.

<p>  The third and final recommendation (you may not have seen this one coming) is the Harry Potter franchise. Okay, so maybe this isn't a movie, but it's impossible to pick one without recommending the rest. If you haven't heard of Harry Potter before, drop everything you are doing and check out this incredibly famous movie franchise about a young wizard named Harry Potter who has all sorts of adventures while attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. His closest friends, Ron and Hermione, accompany him whenever and wherever, providing aid and insightful advice on his quest to overcome Lord Voldemort, the man who killed Harry's parents and started a wizard civil war. While it is occasionally predictable, the series is fun and light-hearted, containing some of the most iconic and unique characters ever, as well as providing an incredible plot peppered with extremely satisfying moments. The actors and actresses maintain their roles throughout the franchise, so you can watch them grow progressively older with the films, making the movie feel immersive, as well as giving you that feeling of "Hey, I remember him!"

  There you have it - my three highest recommendations of movies for returning to school. Each provides a different perspective, from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, where getting out of school leaves room for exploration, to a dream class in the School Of Rock, to Harry Potter, where a school is the stuff dreams are made of.
