        <h4>Let's Celebrate Hanukkah!</h4>
        <h5>Kyra Slutzky</h5>

        <p>In our house during the eight nights of Hanukkah, you might hear us singing joyfully,
          "Hanukkah, oh Hanukkah light the menorah!". First, my family gathers around the table of
          delicious holiday foods. We quickly hop into our seats to say the blessing of that night.
           But before we eat, we should reflect on our past and why we celebrate this holiday.  </p>
        <p>The story I remember from my childhood was when the King of Syria invaded Israel. He made
          those who did not believe in the same Gods give up their religions, like Israel's people. The
           people of Israel were enslaved, but then a man named Judah Macabee stood up to him. Judah and
            his small army defeated the King of Syria! They reclaimed their land and beautiful temple, though
             when they entered, it was destroyed. There was only a tiny amount of oil that would last one night.
             Instead, it lasted eight nights, symbolizing that God was with them! </p>

        <p>Now it's time to feast! Many foods symbolize a part of our proud heritage. For example, Latkes
          symbolize the oil that allowed the candles to burn for eight nights. And serving them with applesauce
           is a sign of the sweet joy felt by Israel's people. </p>

        <p>After we eat, it's time for a game of dreidel! A dreidel has four sides, each with a Hebrew letter for Nes,
           Gimel, Shin, and Hay. The letters mean "A great miracle." My brothers and I gather around a table, laying out
            the chocolate gelt, or chocolate coins, in front of us. My youngest brother spins the dreidel as we sing,
            "Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, we made it out of clay..." Finally, the dreidel lands: it reads
             Gimel. My brother screams with excitement, taking all of our gelt. It's my turn now! I spin
             the dreidel, staring at it with excitement. It stops spinning, I look over, and it reads Nun.
             "Nooooo," I yell! Nothing for me.  </p>
             <p>After a game of dreidel, my mom brings gifts. We open our presents as we all receive a
               fun game or clothing item! Now, it's time for bed. We go to sleep, dreaming about the
                next night of Hanukkah, reflecting upon our background, and of course, receiving more gifts! </p>
