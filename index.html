        <h4>Return to school...</h4>
        <p>Lauren’s Point of View:</p>
        <p> Heading back to school in a pandemic with new rules, outdoor classes, and full school schedules
have been challenging. But imagine navigating so many changes while also trying to go through
the college application process - entirely online. All of us have had to adapt and quickly. With
only two planning days to prepare, we threw ourselves into online life, and those three months
forced students and teachers to look to innovative solutions, new technology, and alternative
methods of understanding to get the most out of our education, all from our homes. Over the
summer, we remained hopeful for an in-person return to school and overfall normalcy, especially
for seniors. The senior class, myself included, craved the first day of school assembly, the
bonding trip, the film fest, and all of the traditions that we have grown up accustomed to over the
years. It quickly became apparent that these hopes were not reality. Our perspectives changed;
we no longer wished for the assembly or the bonding trip. We just wanted to find some normalcy
and be together as a class. And when we finally got the good news that we were going back in
person by the third week of school, we prepared for what would be an exciting, but not an easy,
transition. Heading back to school is an experiment between balancing the safety, social,
academic, and emotional needs of each individual on campus. With the current climate of our
country, we must be adaptable to our school's new changes and environment. The biggest
challenges have been social distancing from other grades, learning outdoors, avoiding grades
crossing between bathroom trips, and leaving school at 3:15. These challenges are only small
obstacles that we overcome. Ultimately we are happy to be back on campus and learn in person
with our teachers and classmates. And in the end, while school doesn't look like we might have

expected over the years, seeing our friends and teachers face-to-face is a gift that we will not
soon forget.</p>

        <p> Faith’s Point of View:</p>
        <p>After transitioning to online school due to a global pandemic, we now have the challenge of
coming back to in-person school. We had to transition online at the end of March, where we had
to adapt quickly to the adjustment. We did not have time to learn our way around zoom, which
was one of our primary forms of communication, before our first class. During this time, we had
the advantage of waking up later than we usually did in person. But the real struggle was to hold
myself accountable not to procrastinate when we were still in class but off of zoom. Even with
the advantages of online school, I desperately wanted to go back in person after three months
online.</p>

</p>Finally, after a couple of weeks online at the beginning of this school year, we got to see each
other in person for enrichment classes and eventually transitioned to full time in person. With the
excitement of coming back and seeing friends, I overlooked the flexibility that I needed. When
we got back to in-person, we had to adapt to a whole new schedule. The new schedule consists of
longer days, fewer breaks in between classes, and more courses in a day. Another change that we
had to learn was the new safety rules like having certain places to sit by grade during lunch and
snack and not having students from different grades congregate in the bathroom.</p>

<p>After three months of only seeing two-dimensional heads on zoom, returning and seeing people,
not as heads on Zoom, was excellent. This whole experience of going online and coming back
has made me extremely more flexible. Going online has made me more appreciative of the
smaller and routine aspects of the school.</p>

<p>Luke’s Point of View:</p>
<p>What was your expectation? Did anything surprise you?</p>
<p>What was your expectation? Did anything surprise you? </p>
<p> There wasn't anything surprising because we've been living with covid for so long now. I think most people have gotten used to it by now. </p>
<p>Describe how it was online while people were in person?</p>
<p>When people came back in person, and I was still online, occasionally, it was hard to hear, and it was hard to see what was on the board. But overall, it was hard, but it wasn't too bad. </p>
<p>What did help make the transition back a little more smooth?</p>
<p>The teachers were understanding and welcoming, which made the transition pretty seamless. Since it was at the beginning of a new block, it made transitioning pretty easy.</p>
<p> Was it challenging to remember the covid rules, and what made social distancing easier?
</p>
<p>Having cohorts made the social distancing a lot easier, but it took a while to get into the new rules' flow. Remaining socially-distanced has been the hardest rule for me, but it's for our safety, helping the mindset part of it. </p>
<p>How did your flexibility change from in-person vs. online?</p>
<p>For me, working online was more demanding because of the screen time. I think that it's easier to communicate with teachers in person and have more time to work in class. Waking up early in the morning was a significant difficulty because I could wake up a lot later online.</p>
